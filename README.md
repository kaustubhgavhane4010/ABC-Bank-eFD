# Business Case: One of the leading banks across the globe, is ABC Bank. It has a presence in 56 countries in the world. ABC Bank currently has a manual option to create fixed deposits. The bank users go to the nearest ABC Bank branch and create a fixed deposit. ABC Bank has a future vision of being a 100% online bank and wants to do away with all its manual banking processes. They have identified the need to create e-fixed deposits. ABC Bank currently wants to introduce this to their existing bank users with a future plan of introducing this feature to non-ABC Bank users.
